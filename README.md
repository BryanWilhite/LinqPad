# My LinqPad Queries Collection

This is my personal collection of [LinqPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) queries that I use to work out in C# (and, soon, F#). The public purpose of this repository is to set an example for beginner developers to make a _personal_ practice “normal” instead of depending on the current IT shop to “encourage” self-improvement/self-education.

## Paragraph to Stop You from Looking at this Repository

From a brutish, managerial point of view, this repository provides tangible proof that a developer took the time to learn a new concept/technique through direct action. This concept/technique may not be committed to rote memory and retrievable on command during a “job interview” but the cognitive moment clearly occurred and can be relearned in microseconds upon revisiting the relevant artifact.

## My LinqPad Query Highlights

* My [JSON.NET experiments](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Json.NET).
* My [NAudio experiments](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/tree/master/Queries/funkyKB/Audio).
* My [WPF research](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/tree/master/Queries/funkyKB/WPF).
* My [interview with Google](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/blob/master/Queries/funkyKB/Interview%20-%20Google.linq).
* My [interview with Microsoft](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/blob/master/Queries/funkyKB/Interview%20-%20Microsoft.linq).
* My interview with JPL ([part 1](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/blob/master/Queries/funkyKB/Interview%20-%20JPL%20(part%201).linq) and [part 2](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/blob/master/Queries/funkyKB/Interview%20-%20JPL%20(part%202).linq)).

## Getting WPF Queries Working

My LinqPad `\Plugins` folder is shown below:

This shows the files needed (from Microsoft) to get my WPF samples working.
