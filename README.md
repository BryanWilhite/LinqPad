# My LinqPad Queries Collection

This is my personal collection of [LinqPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) queries that I use to work out in C#. The public purpose of this repository is to set an example for beginner developers to make a _personal_ practice “normal” instead of depending on the current IT shop to “encourage” self-improvement/self-education.

From a brutish, managerial point of view, this repository provides tangible proof that a developer took the time to learn a new concept/technique through direct action. This concept/technique may not be committed to rote memory and retrievable on command during a “job interview” but the cognitive moment clearly occurred and can be relearned in microseconds upon revisiting the relevant artifact.
