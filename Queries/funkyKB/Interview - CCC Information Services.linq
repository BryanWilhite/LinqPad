    The following is an imperfect recollection
    of the only question in a multi-hour interview
    i failed to answer. This question was actually for SQL,
    higlighting the importance of `UNION`.

    Find all of the vehicles that have the following attributes:

    * has all-wheel drive
    * does not have lane-keeping assist
    * has a hatchback or a moon roof
